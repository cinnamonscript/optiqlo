OPTIQLO
Optiqlo is an e-commerce web application designed to optimise the customer experience for buying spectacle frames.

Optiqlo was built on the Flask framework using Python, and it uses SQLAlchemy to access the databse on SQLite.
The database for this project is included.

This web application allows users to browse products via different categories and sort through by filters. It allows
users to add items to cart, delete items from cart, and empty the whole basket, or check-out by entering their
contact and personal details.
